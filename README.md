# San-Liu-Baozi
A python script to simplify and simulate the Chinese dice gambling game San Liu Baozi, also known as "Cee Lo" or "4-5-6"

Various rulesets exist for the game, the one I used is as follows:
cee lo scoring:
4-5-6 
The highest possible roll. If you roll 4-5-6, you automatically win.
Trips 
Rolling three of the same number is known as rolling "trips". Higher trips beat lower trips, so 4-4-4 is better than 3-3-3. Any trips beats any established point.
Point 
Rolling a pair, and another number, establishes the singleton as a "point". A higher point beats a lower point, so 2-2-6 is better than 5-5-2.
1-2-3
The lowest possible roll. If you roll 1-2-3, you automatically lose.
